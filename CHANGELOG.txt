üéµ NEW FEATURE: Multi-Platform Music Links
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've significantly expanded the platform link extraction system! Now when you
browse albums, you'll see links to multiple music streaming and information
platforms, not just Bandcamp.

‚ú® What's New:

  ‚Ä¢ 7 Platform Support: Albums now display links to:
    üéµ Bandcamp      - Independent music platform
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  YouTube       - Video and music streaming
    üéß Spotify       - Music streaming service
    üíø Discogs       - Music database and marketplace
    üìª Last.fm       - Music discovery and scrobbling
    ‚òÅÔ∏è  SoundCloud    - Audio sharing platform
    üåä Tidal         - High-fidelity music streaming

  ‚Ä¢ Smart Link Detection: The scraper automatically finds and extracts links
    from Metal Archives' "Related Links" section for each band

  ‚Ä¢ Beautiful UI: Platform links appear as color-coded buttons with icons,
    making it easy to identify and access your preferred service

  ‚Ä¢ Configurable: System administrators can enable/disable specific platforms
    via configuration settings

üìä How It Works:

  1. When scraping albums, the system now visits each band's "Related Links"
     page on Metal Archives
  
  2. It searches for links matching known platform patterns (youtube.com,
     spotify.com, etc.)
  
  3. Found links are stored in the database alongside album information
  
  4. When viewing albums, all available platform links appear as clickable
     buttons below the album details

üéØ User Benefits:

  ‚Ä¢ Quick Access: Click any platform button to instantly open the album on
    your preferred music service
  
  ‚Ä¢ More Options: No longer limited to just Bandcamp - access albums across
    multiple platforms
  
  ‚Ä¢ Visual Clarity: Color-coded buttons with emoji icons make it easy to
    spot your favorite platforms at a glance
  
  ‚Ä¢ Complete Information: See all available streaming options in one place

üîß Technical Details:

  Backend Changes:
  - Added platform link extraction to scraper (scraper.py)
  - Updated database schema with 6 new URL columns (db_manager.py)
  - Enhanced Album data model with platform URL fields (models.py)
  - Added configurable platform settings (config.py)

  Frontend Changes:
  - Created reusable PlatformLinks component (PlatformLinks.tsx)
  - Updated Album type definitions (types.ts)
  - Enhanced both AlbumDisplay and EnhancedAlbumDisplay components
  - Added platform-specific styling and icons

üìù Notes:

  ‚Ä¢ Existing Data: Previously scraped albums won't have the new platform links.
    You'll need to re-scrape dates to get the additional links.
  
  ‚Ä¢ Link Availability: Not all bands have links to all platforms. Only
    available links are displayed.
  
  ‚Ä¢ Metal Archives Source: Links are extracted from Metal Archives' official
    "Related Links" section, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Previous Update: Authentication & Mobile Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent improvements from earlier commits:

  ‚Ä¢ Conditional Admin Button: Admin panel button now only appears when
    authenticated, improving security and UX

  ‚Ä¢ Mobile Responsive Design: Enhanced mobile layout with:
    - Condensed date format for smaller screens
    - Responsive filter drawer (bottom sheet on mobile, side drawer on desktop)
    - Sticky headers and bottom actions in filter panel
    - Touch-friendly interface elements

================================================================================

üöÄ Getting Started:

To see the new platform links:

  1. Start the application (backend + frontend)
  2. Use the admin panel to scrape albums for a specific date
  3. Browse to that date's albums
  4. Look for the platform link buttons below each album's details
  5. Click any button to open the album on that platform
