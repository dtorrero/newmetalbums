================================================================================

Version: October 7, 2025
================================================================================

üóìÔ∏è NEW FEATURE: Month/Week/Day Grouping with Smart Filtering
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major enhancement to the release dates browsing experience! You can now view
albums grouped by month, week, or day, with intelligent backend filtering that
handles large datasets efficiently.

‚ú® What's New:

  ‚Ä¢ View Mode Toggle: Switch between Day, Week, and Month views on the home page
    - Day View: Individual dates (existing behavior)
    - Week View: Albums grouped by ISO week (e.g., "Week of Sep 23-29, 2025")
    - Month View: Albums grouped by month (e.g., "September 2025")

  ‚Ä¢ Aggregated Statistics: Period cards show:
    - Total album count across all dates in the period
    - Number of dates with releases
    - Top genres for the period

  ‚Ä¢ Backend Filtering & Pagination: Efficient handling of large datasets
    - Filters applied at database level (SQL WHERE clauses)
    - Pagination works on filtered results (not raw data)
    - Handles 2000+ albums per month without performance issues

  ‚Ä¢ Smart Filtering Behavior:
    - Single dates: Client-side filtering (instant, no API calls)
    - Periods: Backend filtering (scalable, handles large datasets)
    - Automatic detection and appropriate strategy selection

  ‚Ä¢ Debounced Search: 500ms delay on search input for periods to prevent
    API spam while typing

üìä How It Works:

  1. Home page displays three toggle buttons: [Day] [Week] [Month]
  
  2. Select your preferred view to see grouped release periods
  
  3. Click any period card to view albums with full card layout and filters
  
  4. For large periods (e.g., months with 500+ albums):
     - Only 50 albums loaded per page
     - Genre filters trigger backend query
     - Pagination shows correct filtered counts
     - Search is debounced to reduce server load

üéØ User Benefits:

  ‚Ä¢ Better Overview: See release patterns across weeks and months
  
  ‚Ä¢ Efficient Browsing: Navigate large datasets without performance issues
  
  ‚Ä¢ Correct Pagination: Filter shows "5 albums found, 1 page" instead of
    fragmented results across multiple pages
  
  ‚Ä¢ Consistent Experience: Same card layout and genre filters work everywhere
  
  ‚Ä¢ Mobile Optimized: All views work smoothly on mobile devices

  ‚Ä¢ Filtering now also groups be subgenres. When filtering the next filters will
    show subgenres of the selected filter, when deselecting we will go back to the 
    general genres fitler. 

üîß Technical Details:

  Backend Changes:
  - Added get_dates_grouped() method with SQL grouping by day/week/month
  - Enhanced get_albums_by_period() with genre_filters and search_query params
  - New API endpoint: GET /api/dates/grouped?view=day|week|month
  - Updated API endpoint: GET /api/albums/period/{type}/{key}?genres=...&search=...
  - SQL-based filtering with proper WHERE clauses and pagination

  Frontend Changes:
  - Updated DateBrowser with ToggleButtonGroup for view mode selection
  - Enhanced EnhancedAlbumDisplay to support both dates and periods
  - Added debouncing logic for search input (periods only)
  - Smart filtering: client-side for dates, backend for periods
  - Automatic page reset when filters change
  - Updated TypeScript types: PeriodInfo, PeriodsResponse, PeriodAlbumsResponse
  - Enhanced API client with filtering parameters

  Database:
  - No schema changes required
  - Uses existing release_date field with strftime() for grouping
  - Efficient SQL queries with proper indexing

üìù Notes:

  ‚Ä¢ Performance: Tested with 2000+ albums per month - smooth performance
  
  ‚Ä¢ Backward Compatible: Single date view works exactly as before
  
  ‚Ä¢ Filter Accuracy: Backend filtering ensures pagination counts are correct
  
  ‚Ä¢ Memory Efficient: Only loads 50 albums at a time, regardless of total count

üéµ NEW FEATURE: Multi-Platform Music Links
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've significantly expanded the platform link extraction system! Now when you
browse albums, you'll see links to multiple music streaming and information
platforms, not just Bandcamp.

‚ú® What's New:

  ‚Ä¢ 7 Platform Support: Albums now display links to:
    üéµ Bandcamp      - Independent music platform
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  YouTube       - Video and music streaming
    üéß Spotify       - Music streaming service
    üíø Discogs       - Music database and marketplace
    üìª Last.fm       - Music discovery and scrobbling
    ‚òÅÔ∏è  SoundCloud    - Audio sharing platform
    üåä Tidal         - High-fidelity music streaming

  ‚Ä¢ Smart Link Detection: The scraper automatically finds and extracts links
    from Metal Archives' "Related Links" section for each band

  ‚Ä¢ Beautiful UI: Platform links appear as color-coded buttons with icons,
    making it easy to identify and access your preferred service

  ‚Ä¢ Configurable: System administrators can enable/disable specific platforms
    via configuration settings

üìä How It Works:

  1. When scraping albums, the system now visits each band's "Related Links"
     page on Metal Archives
  
  2. It searches for links matching known platform patterns (youtube.com,
     spotify.com, etc.)
  
  3. Found links are stored in the database alongside album information
  
  4. When viewing albums, all available platform links appear as clickable
     buttons below the album details

üéØ User Benefits:

  ‚Ä¢ Quick Access: Click any platform button to instantly open the album on
    your preferred music service
  
  ‚Ä¢ More Options: No longer limited to just Bandcamp - access albums across
    multiple platforms
  
  ‚Ä¢ Visual Clarity: Color-coded buttons with emoji icons make it easy to
    spot your favorite platforms at a glance
  
  ‚Ä¢ Complete Information: See all available streaming options in one place

üîß Technical Details:

  Backend Changes:
  - Added platform link extraction to scraper (scraper.py)
  - Updated database schema with 6 new URL columns (db_manager.py)
  - Enhanced Album data model with platform URL fields (models.py)
  - Added configurable platform settings (config.py)

  Frontend Changes:
  - Created reusable PlatformLinks component (PlatformLinks.tsx)
  - Updated Album type definitions (types.ts)
  - Enhanced both AlbumDisplay and EnhancedAlbumDisplay components
  - Added platform-specific styling and icons

üìù Notes:

  ‚Ä¢ Existing Data: Previously scraped albums won't have the new platform links.
    You'll need to re-scrape dates to get the additional links.
  
  ‚Ä¢ Link Availability: Not all bands have links to all platforms. Only
    available links are displayed.
  
  ‚Ä¢ Metal Archives Source: Links are extracted from Metal Archives' official
    "Related Links" section, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Previous Update: Authentication & Mobile Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent improvements from earlier commits:

  ‚Ä¢ Conditional Admin Button: Admin panel button now only appears when
    authenticated, improving security and UX

  ‚Ä¢ Mobile Responsive Design: Enhanced mobile layout with:
    - Condensed date format for smaller screens
    - Responsive filter drawer (bottom sheet on mobile, side drawer on desktop)
    - Sticky headers and bottom actions in filter panel
    - Touch-friendly interface elements

================================================================================

üöÄ Getting Started:

To see the new platform links:

  1. Start the application (backend + frontend)
  2. Use the admin panel to scrape albums for a specific date
  3. Browse to that date's albums
  4. Look for the platform link buttons below each album's details
  5. Click any button to open the album on that platform

For questions or issues, please check the project documentation or create
an issue on the project repository.
